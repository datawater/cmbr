## How to contribute to CMBR

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/datawater/cmbr/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/datawater/cmbr/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of CMBR will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Check if the feature request is already reported in [issues](https://github.com/datawater/cmbr/issues). If it is, create a pull request.
* If not, create an issue and a pull request, though it's beware that your changes may not be accepted.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Email me at [datawater1@gmail.com](mailto:datawater1@gmail.com?subject=Questions%20about%20cmbr)
